# Pysino - A Virtual Casino in Discord
**Pysino** is a Discord bot that was built using the [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py "discord.py by Rapptz") framework. It allows for the easy implementation of many simple mini-games within a Discord Server. Also paired with a virtual in-app currency, this Discord bot allows for friendly, server-wide competition.
